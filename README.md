Collaborative filtering using matrix factorization

This project uses the MovieLens Small dataset (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)

movieRec optimizes the parameters using a gradient descent algorithm

movieRec_sklearn uses the singular value decomposition, utilizing scikit-learn's TruncatedSVD

next version will include cross-validation for model comparisons to investigate how much each model is improved by adding features/dimensions (with the goal of finding the best number of features)
